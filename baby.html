            <p class="text">
                I worked on this project with the amazing Julia Fernandez. <br />
                You can find her website <a href="https://jftech-art.com/" class="text">here</a>! <br />
                <br />
                The initial plan included LEDs behind the eyes, a servo motor <br />
                spinning the baby’s head, and a recording of a baby crying when an <br />
                unsuspecting trick-or-treater stuck their hand in the bowl. We <br />
                would fix an ultrasonic sensor to the inside of the bowl to detect <br />
                a hand. We considered fixing the head upright or sliced in half <br />
                and fixed like a mask on the bottom of the bowl.<br />
                <br />
                As we began to map this out, it became apparent that sawing the <br />
                baby head in half was not very practical or a good use of our <br />
                time. Additionally, the eyes of the baby seemed to be impossible <br />
                to remove; they were embedded in a thick layer of plastic. Upon <br />
                those discoveries, Aidan and I decided it would be best to ditch <br />
                the LEDs in the head and try animating another part of the baby <br />
                in place of it. A third a final sketch was drafted.<br />
                <br />
                In this sketch, we designed a platform for the servo motors to <br />
                be mounted on. The baby’s head and arm would be mounted on the <br />
                servo motor, and all of the wiring would be hidden underneath <br />
                the platform. A more complete blueprint of the structure of the <br />
                platform is seen in this blueprint:<br />

            </p>
                <p class="text">
                As can be seen in the code above, we declared two separate servo <br />
                motors: one for the baby’s head and one for the baby’s hand. <br />
                After ensuring that both servo motor’s functioned properly, we <br />
                moved onto connecting them to the ultrasonic sensor. Though <br />
                the sensor could detect the full length of the room at 401 <br />
                inches, we set the range for 4 inches. At this point, we were <br />
                confronted with a problem.<br />
                <br />
                Problem: The ultrasonic sensor kept mistaking the moving baby <br />
                extremities for human movement reaching into the bowl. The <br />
                amount of space in the bowl was just too tight for the sensor <br />
                to be able to detect the single motion of a hand moving in <br />
                front of it. We also realized that if the trick-or-treater <br />
                stuck there hand in the bowl at any other position aside from <br />
                where the sensor was aimed, there would be no special effect, <br />
                defeating the purpose of the sensor in the first place.<br />
                <br />
                Solution: We decided that we should point the ultrasonic sensor <br />
                outside of the front of the bowl to detect when a person is <br />
                standing in front of it, close enough to reach for candy. <br />
                Though this isn’t what we wanted ideally, there seemed to be <br />
                no other option. We remapped the range of the ultrasonic sensor <br />
                to 20 inches, a distance we decided on after pretending to reach <br />
                for candy and measuring how close the average person stood when <br />
                reaching. Below is a timelapse of the project setup.<br />

                Though this project involves literally taking candy from a <br />
                baby, making it was not like taking candy from a baby. We were <br />
                faced with a number of obstacles including: The baby’s head being <br />
                too heavy for the motor, the unreliability of the ultrasonic sensor <br />
                mapping the ultrasonic sensor, and fitting all of the baby parts <br />
                in the bucket. <br />
                <br />
                Despite these challenges, we are pleased with our final product. <br />
                We’ve learned a lot about computation this semester, and it was <br />
                really exciting to be able to use our new skills in combination <br />
                with some creativity to make something! In our project we <br />
                revisited topics discussed in class. These topics were: Serial <br />
                communication (we used this to connect sound with the ultrasonic <br />
                sensor), analog input and output (the ultrasonic sensor (I) and <br />
                servo motors (O)), and the p5.js sound library (the audio of <br />
                the crying baby).<br />
                <br />
                Special thanks to DanO for giving us the ultrasonic sensor, Arnab <br />
                for helping us work out the code for the audio, and David for <br />
                also helping us with code and playing lots of stress-relieving <br />
                ping pong games in between work.<br />
