            <p class="text">
                I worked on this project with the amazing Julia Fernandez. 
                You can find her website <a href="https://jftech-art.com/" class="link" target="_blank">here</a>! 
                <br />
                <br />
                The initial plan included LEDs behind the eyes, a servo motor 
                spinning the baby’s head, and a recording of a baby crying when an 
                unsuspecting trick-or-treater stuck their hand in the bowl. We 
                would fix an ultrasonic sensor to the inside of the bowl to detect 
                a hand. We considered fixing the head upright or sliced in half 
                and fixed like a mask on the bottom of the bowl.
                <br />
                <br />
                As we began to map this out, it became apparent that sawing the 
                baby head in half was not very practical or a good use of our 
                time. Additionally, the eyes of the baby seemed to be impossible 
                to remove; they were embedded in a thick layer of plastic. Upon 
                those discoveries, Aidan and I decided it would be best to ditch 
                the LEDs in the head and try animating another part of the baby 
                in place of it. A third a final sketch was drafted.
                <br />
                <br />
                In this sketch, we designed a platform for the servo motors to 
                be mounted on. The baby’s head and arm would be mounted on the 
                servo motor, and all of the wiring would be hidden underneath 
                the platform. A more complete blueprint of the structure of the 
                platform is seen in this blueprint:

            </p>
                <p class="text">
                As can be seen in the code above, we declared two separate servo 
                motors: one for the baby’s head and one for the baby’s hand.
                After ensuring that both servo motor’s functioned properly, we 
                moved onto connecting them to the ultrasonic sensor. Though 
                the sensor could detect the full length of the room at 401 
                inches, we set the range for 4 inches. At this point, we were 
                confronted with a problem.
                <br />
                <br />
                Problem: The ultrasonic sensor kept mistaking the moving baby 
                extremities for human movement reaching into the bowl. The 
                amount of space in the bowl was just too tight for the sensor 
                to be able to detect the single motion of a hand moving in 
                front of it. We also realized that if the trick-or-treater 
                stuck there hand in the bowl at any other position aside from 
                where the sensor was aimed, there would be no special effect, 
                defeating the purpose of the sensor in the first place.
                <br />
                <br />
                Solution: We decided that we should point the ultrasonic sensor 
                outside of the front of the bowl to detect when a person is 
                standing in front of it, close enough to reach for candy. 
                Though this isn’t what we wanted ideally, there seemed to be 
                no other option. We remapped the range of the ultrasonic sensor 
                to 20 inches, a distance we decided on after pretending to reach 
                for candy and measuring how close the average person stood when 
                reaching. Below is a timelapse of the project setup.

                Though this project involves literally taking candy from a 
                baby, making it was not like taking candy from a baby. We were 
                faced with a number of obstacles including: The baby’s head being 
                too heavy for the motor, the unreliability of the ultrasonic sensor 
                mapping the ultrasonic sensor, and fitting all of the baby parts 
                in the bucket. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Despite these challenges, we are pleased with our final product. 
                We’ve learned a lot about computation this semester, and it was 
                really exciting to be able to use our new skills in combination 
                with some creativity to make something! In our project we 
                revisited topics discussed in class. These topics were: Serial 
                communication (we used this to connect sound with the ultrasonic 
                sensor), analog input and output (the ultrasonic sensor (I) and 
                servo motors (O)), and the p5.js sound library (the audio of 
                the crying baby).
                <br />
                <br />
                Special thanks to DanO for giving us the ultrasonic sensor, Arnab 
                for helping us work out the code for the audio, and David for 
                also helping us with code and playing lots of stress-relieving 
                ping pong games in between work.
