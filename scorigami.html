                What is NFL Scorigami and why did I make this my final? <br />
                NFL Scorigami is a simple way of describing each unique ending <br />
                score to a professional football game. This has no impact on <br />
                the game whatsoever–it’s just a database that shows how many <br />
                times a certain score has happened, when the last time it happened <br />
                was, or even if a certain score exists. I made this my project <br />
                because I’m a huge sports guy. Not only am I a huge sports guy, but <br />
                I’m a huge sports stathead. Something about scrolling through <br />
                websites and charts and tables looking at numbers for individuals, <br />
                their teams, comparing them to other teams, other players, and the <br />
                history of the sport is an absolute blast to me. So, since I <br />
                enjoy this so much, I decided to make a place where users can <br />
                explore the NFL score database. While Scorigami isn’t something <br />
                I made, there’s no simple way to search the database, which is where <br />
                my website comes into play. What did I do? For starters, since I <br />
                was not confident in my API-calling skills, I immediately went for <br />
                the designing first (which I know probably wasn’t the smartest idea, but <br />
                I did it anyway). I wanted the fun and joking atmosphere that Scorigami <br />
                creates to become somewhat serious, so I made the website look <br />
                professional and attempted to give it a serious tone, as if it were <br />
                truly impacting the game of football. I created a mockup of what I <br />
                wanted my homepage and overall vibe of my website to be.

                Since there was no true API for what I was wanting, I had to make <br />
                my own API. I used Pro Football Reference’s database, that gave me the <br />
                count, the last time it happened, and the scores I needed to identify them. <br />
                I scraped all of the data from the site into a .csv format, then <br />
                reformatted it into a .json file. I then made a simple call in my <br />
                javascript to the json file which is being hosted on the same server as <br />
                the actual website. Through this, the user is able to enter in a winning <br />
                and losing score and search 1000+ lines of the .json file. </p>
