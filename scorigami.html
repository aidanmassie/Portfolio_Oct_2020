                What is NFL Scorigami and why did I make this my final? 
                NFL Scorigami is a simple way of describing each unique ending 
                score to a professional football game. This has no impact on 
                the game whatsoever–it’s just a database that shows how many 
                times a certain score has happened, when the last time it happened 
                was, or even if a certain score exists. I made this my project 
                because I’m a huge sports guy. Not only am I a huge sports guy, but 
                I’m a huge sports stathead. Something about scrolling through 
                websites and charts and tables looking at numbers for individuals, 
                their teams, comparing them to other teams, other players, and the 
                history of the sport is an absolute blast to me. 
                <br/> 
                <br />
                So, since I  enjoy this so much, I decided to make a place where users can 
                explore the NFL score database. While Scorigami isn’t something 
                I made, there’s no simple way to search the database, which is where 
                my website comes into play. What did I do? For starters, since I 
                was not confident in my API-calling skills, I immediately went for 
                the designing first (which I know probably wasn’t the smartest idea, but
                I did it anyway). I wanted the fun and joking atmosphere that Scorigami 
                creates to become somewhat serious, so I made the website look 
                professional and attempted to give it a serious tone, as if it were 
                truly impacting the game of football. I created a mockup of what I 
                wanted my homepage and overall vibe of my website to be.

                Since there was no true API for what I was wanting, I had to make 
                my own API. I used Pro Football Reference’s database, that gave me the 
                count, the last time it happened, and the scores I needed to identify them. 
                I scraped all of the data from the site into a .csv format, then 
                reformatted it into a .json file. I then made a simple call in my 
                javascript to the json file which is being hosted on the same server as 
                the actual website. Through this, the user is able to enter in a winning 
                and losing score and search 1000+ lines of the .json file. </p>
