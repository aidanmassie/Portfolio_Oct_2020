            <p class="text">
                I've always had a passion for anything to do with a camera. 
                I tried to make my first film at age 8 and have been constantly trying
                to improve ever since. I've always wanted to be the guy with 
                the nicest cameras, making the coolest videos that millions of 
                people will watch. I'm not on that level, but I don't think I'm 
                too shabby either. 
                <br />

                Below are some of my most recent video works! Give them a look!

                <p class="text">
                One of my good friends from high school, Caleb Wallis, plays
                college basketball at the University of Rio Grande. While I was
                home on a break from school, I got to shoot this video for him
                at one of Rio Grande's games.

                I got to edit this video, shot by the GOAT herself, for the LA 
                Sparks social media accounts during my internship. We used this 
                video as a push for Lisa Leslie votes during the WNBA's GOAT Vote 
                campaign.

                <p class="textTitle"><span class="highlight">New Frontier Outfitters - Only in Appalachia</span></p>
                <p class="text">
                During my summer internship with Only in Appalachia, I had the 
                privilege of traveling across the northern half of Appalachia, 
                interviewing Appalachians making a difference in their community 
                and sharing their story with the region. 
                <br />
                <br />
                In this video, I interviewed Josh and Jared Ravenscraft, the owners 
                of New Frontier Outfitters, a clothing brand based in Morehead, KY 
                that sells Appalachian-based gear, as well as Kash Daniel, a former 
                University of Kentucky football player.

                <p class="textTitle"><span class="highlight">The Spot on Main Commerical</span></p>
                <p class="text">
                In my small town in Southern Ohio, my family owns a coffee shop 
                named The Spot on Main. In the summer of 2019, we were looking 
                to attract more teenagers to the shop and create a cool environment 
                for students to connect and do homework. So, we decided to create 
                a thirty second commerical for the shop that aired in the local 
                movie theater before every movie.

                <p class="text">
                During my brief stint with NYU Atheltics, prior to the COVID-19 
                pandemic, I created highlight videos of men's and women's basketball
                games, wrestling matches, and volleyball matches. These videos were
                edited and completed on the same night as the event, and published
                the following day on all NYU Athletics social accounts and websites.

                <p class="textTitle"><span class="highlight">Oak Hill Union Football Livestream</span></p>
                <p class="text">
                One cool thing that came out of me studying remotely during the 
                Fall 2020 semester was the opportunity to livestream a local high 
                school's home football games! I was hired as a freelancer and 
                operated an on-the-field camera, as well as help setup the livestream 
                using professional-level streaming equipment. 
                <br />
                <br />
                The video above is one of the livestreams, where we used three 
                cameras, on-field audio, and audio from the local radio station 
                for play-by-play commentary.
