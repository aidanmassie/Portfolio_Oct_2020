                During my time as an intern for the Los Angeles Sparks, I was fortunate
                enough to work with many individuals from across the country. During the 
                experience, there were many of my colleagues who moved on to jobs elsewhere,
                which was bittersweet, but those departures gave me the opportunity to fill
                some holes I wouldn't have had to fill before. I was able to help manage the 
                LA Sparks website and video platforms, but additionally help create graphics 
                for our social pages. I was able to immensely grow in my design skillset, and 
                build more of a passion for design. Check out some projects below!
                <br/> 
                <br />
            </p>
                <img src="NnekaOgwumike_Is_Back.png" class="nnekaimg" alt="nneka graphic" />
            <p class="textSubTitle"><span class="highlight">Nneka Ogwumike is Back</span></p>
            <p class="text">
                Following the Olympic Break came the return of former MVP, Nneka Ogwumike. 
                The team had been riddled with injuries the entire first half of the season,
                and getting an All-Star caliber player back in the lineup was key to our
                success. In conjunction with a video to highlight Nneka's return for socials,
                I made this simple graphic for my fellow intern, where it was used in the
                intro of the graphic.

            <p class="textSubTitle"><span class="highlight">Gameday Graphic Mockup</span></p>
            <p class="text">
                After the Olympic Break began, my supervisor wanted to move forward into the 
                second half of the season with new gameday graphics--ones we could switch
                out based on the uniforms we were wearing for certain games. While this
                never made it to the final stages of production, nor was it used on socials,
                it was something cool that I enjoyed. 
            </p>

            <img src="LA_PHX_ThroughTheYears.png" class="long_image2" alt="LA-PHX Through the years" />
            <p class="textSubTitle"><span class="highlight">LA Sparks vs. Phoenix Mercury - Through The Years</span></p>
            <p class="text">
                The Los Angeles Sparks and Phoenix Mercury are two of three remaining original
                teams from the start of the WNBA. To highlight the history in this storied
                rivalry, I created this graphic to showcase photos through the years, but also
                the sheer dominance the Sparks had put on the Mercury for the past 25 years.

            <p class="textSubTitle"><span class="highlight">Delisha Milton-Jones - Through The Years</span></p>
            <p class="text">
                Similarly to the graphic above, this graphic was created to highlight one of
                the franchise's most valued players in Delisha Milton-Jones. This graphic
                was my first design task for the Sparks, and one I will remember.

            <p class="text">
                For the All-Star voting push, as a marketing team, we were pushing for three
                of our players in the fan voting for the 2021 All-Star Game. While this 
                graphic never made it far in production either, it was still a cool one that 
                highlighted the city of Las Vegas (the host city for the All-Star Game), and 
                the player that was leading our team through injuries.
