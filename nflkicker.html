            <p class="text">
                I’m a huge sports guy. It’s something that I pay attention to every day, 
                something I have a plethora of conversations about, and the industry I 
                want to work in down the road. So, it only made sense for me to do this 
                project on something related to my sports passion. I was watching the 
                Sunday afternoon game in early October of my beloved Cincinnati Bengals 
                facing the Green Bay Packers. During the game, in the final three minutes 
                of the game and in overtime, the Packers had 3 different opportunities to 
                win the game with a field goal (with arguably one of the greatest kickers 
                the sport has ever seen) and missed all three. Additionally, the Bengals 
                had two different opportunities in that same time span to win the game, 
                and missed both attempts. It wasn’t until Green Bay kicker Mason Crosby’s 
                fourth attempt in that time span that he made the game-winning kick. It was 
                a sad moment as a Bengals fan to see my team lose, but in reality, the team 
                shouldn’t have even been in that opportunity to win in the first place. Crosby 
                is supposed to make that first field goal and win, not miss three in a row. So, 
                it begged me to ponder the question: how far have NFL kickers come, and why does it 
                seem like they're missing now more than normal?

                Over the course of history in the National Football League, place
                kickers have seemingly only gotten better. From legends of kicking
                with bare feet, to the famous half shoe worn by Tom Dempsey in the 
                1970s, to the revolutionary synthetic cleats we have today, kicking
                has undergone a massive transformation. And while kickers have seemed
                to only get better as the years go on, why does it still feel like 
                they miss more than they should?
                <br />
                <br />
                First off, what is an NFL kick? A field goal takes place when a team
                in possession of the ball elects to place-kick the ball through the 
                two uprights and above the crossbar, giving them three points to their
                team's total score.

            <p class="textSubTitle"><span class="highlight">NFL Kicker Field Goal Percentage Over Time</span></p>
            <p class="text">
                We begin by examining the growth of NFL kickers over the course of
                the history of football. Since field goal percentage was first 
                recorded in 1938, the NFL has seen its growth double in percentage, 
                jumping from making all field goals only 41% of the time to 83% of
                the time. There are notable rule changes noted on the chart as well,
                from the hash marks moving closer together toward the middle of the
                field in 1972, to the goal posts moving back 10 yards from the front
                of the goal line, to ultimately the banning of the kicking tee in 1989,
                forcing kickers to kick directly off the ground.
                <br />
                <br />
                As kickers have gotten better over time, they've become able to kick
                further distances as well. Field goals can be anywhere from 17 yards
                long to 70, 80, or maybe even 90 yards long, although the record for 
                the longest currently stands at 66 yards long. 
            </p>
                <br />
                <img src="FG_PAT_OverTime.png" class="long_image" alt="graph of kickers field goal percentage over time from certain distances" />
            <p class="textSubTitle"><span class="highlight">Field Goal Percentage Over Time from Certain Distances</span></p>
                <p class="text">
                In this data set, we can see the same rule changes as in the first graph,
                but each line is broken down into a different distance, and as you can infer
                from the data, the closer a field goal is to the endzone, the easier it is 
                to make, and the further away it is to make, the harder it is to make. Since
                field goal percentage from certain distances began being tracked in the 1960s,
                there is tremendous growth in kickers as a whole across the NFL. Yet, when we 
                look closely at present-day, we can see that most lines are not at the peak--most 
                of the lines are on the decline from the peak that came several years
                before. So, just from this data set, we can begin to see that kickers are 
                missing more than they have in the past, yet still immensely better since the 
                beginning. 30-39 yard field goals are down 3.5% from the 2020 season, 40-49
                yard field goals down 1.7%, and 50-59 yard field goals down 3%. 
                <br />
                <br />
                One particular change that's different on this data set is the introduction of
                the Point-After-Touchdown (PAT). The PAT (1 point) takes place directly following a 
                touchdown (6 points) scored by a team. Up until 2015, the PAT took place from 
                the 2-yard line, making it a 19-yard kick. In 2015, though, the NFL changed the 
                rules, forcing kickers to kick PAT's from the 15-yard line, making it a 32-yard
                kick. Their reasoning was that PAT's became too automatic and the game needed
                more challenging kicks to make itself more exciting. Once the NFL changed the 
                rule in 2015, the PAT percentage took a nosedive, comparatively, and became more
                challenging for kickers.
                </p>
                <img src="PAT_OverTime.png" class="long_image" alt="graph of kickers point after touchdown percentage over time" />
            <p class="textSubTitle"><span class="highlight">Point-After-Touchdown Percentage Over Time</span></p>
                <p class="text">
                Looking more closely at PAT percentage over time, we can see that in 2015, the 
                percentage dropped from an automatic 99% to a comparatively worse 94%. While a 
                94% completion percentage is still quite good, it isn't as automatic as 99% and 
                adds a level of uncertainty to the game for fans. Since the rule change, the 
                percentage has only gone down, though, now standing at 92%, the lowest a PAT
                completion percentage has been since 91% during the 1979 season. 
                <br />
                <br />
                Surely, we'll see these numbers bounce back up. If we take a look at the last
                major rule change, the goal posts moving back ten yards in 1974, the PAT 
                percentage dropped drastically from 98% to 91% just two seasons later, and 
                it ultimately rose back up to become automatic. One reason the percentage could
                be lower than last year's is due to the fact that most games were played without
                fans due to COVID-19. Kickers may have gotten used to silent stadiums, and once 
                fans were permitted back into games in 2021, it's taken adjustment for it to 
                become normal again, and we haven't seemingly gotten back to normal yet.
                <br />
                <br />
                So far, we can see that kickers are good at their jobs. Maybe slightly less
                than a few years ago, but they're essentially the best they've been for the 
                duration of NFL history. 
                <br />
                <br />
                But, what if we take a look at kicks when they matter
                most, not necessarily at a random point during the game. For this, I've drawn
                inspiration from other sports and defined the last 3 minutes of the 4th quarter
                and overtime as "Clutch Time." 
                </p>
                <img src="AllKicks_ClutchKicks.png" class="long_image" alt="graph of all kicks percentages vs clutch time kicking percentage" />
            <p class="textSubTitle"><span class="highlight">Kicks at Any Point During a Game vs. During Clutch Time</span></p>
            <p class="text">
                The reason we call the end of a game "clutch time" is because that's when 
                there's potential for the game to be on the line. Example scenario: there's 
                3 seconds left on the clock in the game. Our team has the ball on the 30-yard
                line. We can either kick a 47-yard field goal, or throw up a pass to the endzone
                and hope someone catches it. The kicker in this scenario is called on to win the 
                game, giving him quite a bit of pressure to stick it through the uprights as time 
                expires. When he makes it even under the pressure, that's clutch.
                <br />
                <br />
                In this example, we can see a clear-as-day conclusion that kickers are more 
                proficient in the clutch, which surprises me. But, when looking at the number of
                kicks instead of percentage of field goals made, when can see a substantial 
                difference. This difference mostly comes from just having to be put in the situation
                to kick a field goal during Clutch Time.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                As we see, there's an extraordinarily larger amount of field goal attempts outside 
                of Clutch Time versus attempts during Clutch Time. So, while kickers are making 
                kicks during Clutch Time supposedly more often, they aren't attempting them nearly 
                as often as a normal, random in-game field goal attempt. To further explore Clutch 
                Time, I've brought in a few specific people to examine.

                Introduced above is Harrison Butker, Justin Tucker, Adam Vinatieri, and Mason Crosby,
                all kickers who have reputations of being some of the greatest the game of football 
                has ever seen. These kickers were chosen specifically for their differences in age,
                experience, years in the league, and success. See below their success in both Clutch

            <p class="text">
                Based on this chart, it can be inferred that Justin Tucker and Harrison Butker 
                are extremely accurate kickers, with both making 90% and 91% of all of their field goals, 
                respectively. As for Mason Crosby and Adam Vinatieri, an argument can be made that as 
                with longer careers that yield more attempts, there's a chance that a larger amount of
                kicks during clutch time that could become misses might bring down their percentage.
                <br />
                <br />
                Adam Vinatieri has been the long-proclaimed "Greatest of All-Time" in the NFL. 
                Looking at his percentage in Clutch Time, it proves that he was an extremely
                clutch player that rose to the occasion when the pressure was on. In the modern
                NFL, Justin Tucker can be seen at the Greatest of All-Time, especially when
                looking at his perfect accuracy during Clutch Time. 
                </p>

            <p class="text">
                Based on this chart, it can be interpreted that the further back a kicker gets,
                the more difficult it is to rely on them to make a field goal during Clutch Time
                (unless their name is Justin Tucker). Long field goals are difficult to make in 
                general, but when the added pressure of trying to win or tie the game late is 
                thrown in, it can be even tougher. But, when we're looking at four of the greatest
                kickers the game has ever seen, there isn't as much variety in their success. So,
                to bring in more perspective, I introduce 4 new kickers who have had mediocre careers
                in the NFL.

                    Introduced above is Brandon McManus, Nick Folk, Ryan Succop, and Mike Nugent,
                    all kickers who have been in the NFL for at least 7 years, and 3 of which have
                    bounced around the league from team to team. These kickers were chosen specifically 
                    for their reputation as being decently good, and their ages vary through their 
                    thirties.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Let's take a look at their All-Time Field Goal percentages, in comparison to
                    Clutch Time Field Goal Percentages, but also in addition to the 4 great 
                    kickers we discussed above.

            <p class="textSubTitle"><span class="highlight">8 NFL Kickers Throughout Their Career in General vs in Clutch Time</span></p>
            <p class="text">
                Based on this graph that adds the second group of four with the first, we can 
                compare the second group to the percentage of Mason Crosby's all-time field goal 
                percentage, hovering around 80-82% between the four of them. None of them are 
                the greatest to play the game, but they're reliable kickers. By looking at the 
                new group on the chart, we can see that being on the younger side has potential 
                to take a hit on clutch field goal percentages, given that Brandon McManus' clutch 
                percentage is 73.1%. 
                <br />
                <br />
                By having more experience under their belt, older kickers are probably more likely
                to perform well during clutch time. The pressure is something they're potentially
                used to, and something they know how to brush off. But, when we look at the clutch 
                percentage by distance, we can still see the recurring theme that longer field 
                goals are much more difficult to make, especially under the pressure.

            <p class="textSubTitle"><span class="highlight">8 NFL Kickers Throughout Their Career from Certain Distance in Clutch Time</span></p>
            <p class="text">
                By seeing distance, we can see that almost every kicker's clutch percentage
                goes down the further back the kick is. Additionally, by age, the older a kicker 
                is, the higher percentage chance they have to make a field goal from further
                distances in the clutch, with the exception of Justin Tucker and Harrison Butker. 
                <br />
                <br />
                In conclusion, it feels like we're seeing more missed kicks because we actually
                are. COVID-19 forced stadiums to become empty, and now that they're back, 
                kickers have to adjust to the atmosphere they haven't had in a little under two years.
                Older kickers are more accurate in clutch moments, because they have more experience
                under the pressure. But, maybe they have to be closer to the endzone in order to be that
                accurate so they don't have to kick 60+ yarders they know they can't make with their older body--they're
                reliable at being accurate from distances within their repertoire.  
                Regardless of pressure, the longer the field goal, the more
                insanely difficult it is to make a field goal. Kicking has become a science in the 
                NFL, and one minor adjustment to a routine can cause a kicker to become one of the 
                most hated men in the sport. So, while kickers have become insanely better over 
                the course of NFL history, they're still human and they still miss kicks. And yes,
                they are currently missing more than normal.

                from the University of
                Georgia, who gave some insight on the mental toughness it takes to be a kicker, the 
                science that goes into kicking a field goal, the experience he had in college, and just 
                for sharing some cool stories from his playing days--I was geeking out hardcore.
