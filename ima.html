                For an assignment in my design class, we were tasked with redesigning the
                Interactive Media Arts logo. Across its branding, from website, to social 
                media, and banners, stickers, and signs, the Interactive Media Arts 
                program at NYU has several different messages, themes, fonts, and colors 
                spread across its branding. A combination on Myriad Pro, Montserrat, and 
                a custom, handwritten font contradict one another, and are constantly 
                competing against one another. In my opinion, none of these logos or fonts 
                truly represent the unique and innovative community that IMA creates. IMA 
                is a community of thinkers, makers, believers, hackers, coders, designers, 
                and builders.

                To begin the creative process, I started with creating a collage of words 
                I associate with the IMA program--community, looking forward, creativity, 
                innovation, brilliance, etc. Following this, I moved into the digital realm, 
                forming different ideas that could interpretate these words well. The 
                phrase I decided to move forward with was, “looking forward.”

                One specific concept I wanted to include in the logo was an idea of an 
                arrow pointing forward, while still connecting and acting as a part of the 
                logo. The arrow, to me, represents the innovation that occurs within IMA, 
                and how the people, the ideas, the projects, and the culture are always looking 
                forward for the next big thing to create. I wanted it to still be connected 
                to the IMA as a whole because of how our community brings us together, no 
                matter how separated we are, physically, ideally, or emotionally. I didn’t 
                particularly like my first run at design (top row), so I evaluated, went back, 
                and recreated my ideas in a simpler manner (bottom row). Through further stages 
                of development, I landed on this set (below) to continue with.

            <p class="text">
                During the early stages of this process, I had trouble landing on a color 
                palette that made me both comfortable and feel like the personality of IMA 
                was being captured. Eventually I landed on NYU’s classic color palette of 
                purples, ultimately moving forward with one of them. On the font, I 
                immediately jumped to Proxima Nova, as I felt this font would fit well with 
                an arrow moving forward, plus, it looks very nice in lowercase. I began 
                doubting myself after the first stage of digital creation, as I didn’t like 
                the Proxima Nova in all caps, but I felt like I found the sweet spot once I 
                experimented with the font in lowercase.

            <p class="text">
                For the second-to-last look of this design, I went with the arrow on top of 
                the “ima”. The final look is a combination of two separate logos, the dotted i,
                and the straight line. The purple dot in the “i” represents being able to 
                stand out as an artist, designer, builder, etc. The arrow represents 
                said artist, designer, builder moving forward, looking toward the future, 
                like aforementioned. I took it one step further after this, because, you know
                me, and you know I'm not satisfied.

                This was my final draft of the logo redesign assignment. I wasn't in love
                with the rounded line overtop of the text, so I returned to the blockiness
                in the left side of the arrow, giving it the dot that I enjoyed so much, as 
                well as the arrow that I enjoyed so much. The viewer is able to see that both
                are separate, yet together at the same time.
