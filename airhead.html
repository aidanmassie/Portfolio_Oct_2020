                Inspired by the exaggeration of emotions in German Expressionism, 
                Airhead is a performance piece that forces the user to face a 
                visualization of the mounting anxiety they faced while in isolation 
                and excessive self-reflection this past year. I worked on this project
                with Isabelle Rieken and Faith Zeng.

                For this project, we began by testing both the physical fabrication 
                and the Isadora sketch to make sure both could work independently. 
                Testing the balloon included finding the right air pump, and timing 
                the pop to make sure our Isadora sketch would sync up. We also had 
                to figure out a few technical things such as how to keep the balloon 
                pump blowing up on its own, how the balloon stayed attached, and how 
                to hide the pump.

                As for setup, we had the subject sitting in a chair, facing the balloon
                and a camera on a tripod directly beneath it. Above the subject, we hung
                a projector from the ceiling using a tripod arm. Beneath the subject, we
                had a speaker playing relaxing piano music. Behind the subject, Faith was
                manning the computer with Isadora to make sure everything was running 
                smoothly, as well as initiating the start of the performance. Behind Faith,
                I was stationed with an extension cord, which was run to the balloon pump,
                and plugged the cord into the wall at Faith's cue. The balloon pump was
                stationed inside a black box that we built through a laser cutter, and was
                rigged to automatically be pushed down to blow air as soon as it received
                power. Once the balloon popped, we programmed the Isadora sketch to
                immediately stop the video output and the music playing, and it was able to
                stop through a simple audio-in watcher, waiting for the input on Faith's 
                computer to reach a certain level.
                <br />

                We had a few errors throughout this process, including one right when we
                felt we were about to end the project as a whole. During the trial run,
                the sequence of events seemed to be running smoothly, up until the air pump
                began stuttering its air flow, causing the balloon to never pop. We think the 
                pump may have been overheating, but are not confident in those findings. 
                Thankfully, we were able to capture the piece (first video above) right before
                the air pump completely died on us, probably from overheating. You can watch
                that failed run below.

                Overall, we ended up happy with the result, and could potentially work with
                this in further detail down the road. As for music, my dear friend, Sam Gryzwa,
                also known as Isle'r, was kind enough to let us use one of his new singles 
                "Through the Glass" as our calming piano music. You can find Isle'r on Spotify
                <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/444fSLLJp6eo8pEgta6qsG">here,</a> or on Instagram as @isler_nyc.
