                This project is an interactive game of paper football, on a much<br />
                larger scale, of course. This game works by kicking an old-fashioned<br />
                paper football between the two yellow uprights. The paper football <br />
                then drops down into a small box, where it ramps towards an ultrasonic <br />
                sensor that detects distance. Once the distance is less than 6 inches, <br />
                it sends the data through my Arduino, through the p5.serialcontrol app, <br />
                and into p5.js itself to trigger an animation that says, “And it’s good!” <br />
                and plays a sound clip of a crowd cheering as well. Attached below <br />
                is a video of the beginning stages of the project. <br />

                I originally intended for the net itself to be the sensor that <br />
                triggered the animation, but due to a lack of fish netting in New <br />
                York City (maybe this place isn’t so great after all), I had to <br />
                make a net out of 40 feet of rope, which proved to be a difficult <br />
                task and not what I wanted either. I was then forced to nix the idea <br />
                of the net being the sensor and just use it as decoration for the <br />
                project. I had to use just a hard back for the paper football to hit, <br />
                forcing it to drop into a box I then had to design. Inside the box, <br />
                there are three ramps that direct the paper football towards the <br />
                ultrasonic sensor. Also, huge thanks to my father, Erik Massie, for <br />
                getting ahold of some copper pipe for me to use for the field goal <br />
                posts (he’d be mad if I didn’t give a shoutout–sorry for the <br />
                interruption in this reading). Attached below is the final layout <br />
                of the project and the project in use. <br />

                I became interested in this project during the process of developing <br />
                my midterm project, but didn’t think I had the skillset to accomplish <br />
                it yet. So, I held off on it until now, where I still struggled to <br />
                make it work. I love the sports industry, so much that I wish to work <br />
                in it someday following college. So, taking that into account, I <br />
                wanted to build something that was framed around sports, which led me <br />
                to paper football. <br />
                <br /> 
                My most difficult obstacle, technically, was building something that <br />
                sent the paper football towards the ultrasonic sensor. Even though <br />
                there were ramps inside the box, there was still a way for it to not <br />
                completely move down them or even hit them at all. This obstacle <br />
                proved to be something that could potentially ruin presentation of <br />
                the project, because if the football didn’t hit the sensor, nothing <br />
                would work. My second most difficult obstacle was myself. I had very <br />
                low levels of faith in myself and my abilities to build something <br />
                that worked, especially after what I wanted at first didn’t work. <br />
                I definitely learned more about having to work with the obstacles <br />
                I am given and attempt to create something that still worked. <br />
                <br />
                Thanks to everyone in this class for their feedback for the project. <br />
                Thanks to Dano for teaching me everything I used in this project. <br />
                Thanks to Arnab for dealing with my debugging struggles. Thanks to <br />
                David for moral support. <br />
