                This project is an interactive game of paper football, on a much
                larger scale, of course. This game works by kicking an old-fashioned
                paper football between the two yellow uprights. The paper football 
                then drops down into a small box, where it ramps towards an ultrasonic 
                sensor that detects distance. Once the distance is less than 6 inches, 
                it sends the data through my Arduino, through the p5.serialcontrol app, 
                and into p5.js itself to trigger an animation that says, “And it’s good!” 
                and plays a sound clip of a crowd cheering as well. Attached below 
                is a video of the beginning stages of the project.

            <p class="text">
                I originally intended for the net itself to be the sensor that 
                triggered the animation, but due to a lack of fish netting in New 
                York City (maybe this place isn’t so great after all), I had to 
                make a net out of 40 feet of rope, which proved to be a difficult 
                task and not what I wanted either. I was then forced to nix the idea 
                of the net being the sensor and just use it as decoration for the 
                project. I had to use just a hard back for the paper football to hit, 
                forcing it to drop into a box I then had to design. Inside the box, 
                there are three ramps that direct the paper football towards the 
                ultrasonic sensor. Also, huge thanks to my father, Erik Massie, for 
                getting ahold of some copper pipe for me to use for the field goal 
                posts (he’d be mad if I didn’t give a shoutout–sorry for the 
                interruption in this reading). Attached below is the final layout 
                of the project and the project in use.

                <p class="text">
                I became interested in this project during the process of developing 
                my midterm project, but didn’t think I had the skillset to accomplish 
                it yet. So, I held off on it until now, where I still struggled to 
                make it work. I love the sports industry, so much that I wish to work 
                in it someday following college. So, taking that into account, I 
                wanted to build something that was framed around sports, which led me 
                to paper football. 
                <br /> 
                <br />
                My most difficult obstacle, technically, was building something that 
                sent the paper football towards the ultrasonic sensor. Even though 
                there were ramps inside the box, there was still a way for it to not 
                completely move down them or even hit them at all. This obstacle 
                proved to be something that could potentially ruin presentation of 
                the project, because if the football didn’t hit the sensor, nothing 
                would work. My second most difficult obstacle was myself. I had very 
                low levels of faith in myself and my abilities to build something 
                that worked, especially after what I wanted at first didn’t work. 
                I definitely learned more about having to work with the obstacles 
                I am given and attempt to create something that still worked.

                Thanks to everyone in this class for their feedback for the project. 
                Thanks to Dano for teaching me everything I used in this project. 
                Thanks to Arnab for dealing with my debugging struggles. Thanks to 
                David for moral support.
